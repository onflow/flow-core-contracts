/* 
*
*  Manages the process of generating a group key with the participation of all the consensus nodes
*  for the upcoming epoch.
*
*  When consensus nodes are first confirmed, they can request a Participant object from this contract
*  They'll use this object for every subsequent epoch that they are a staked consensus node.
*
*  At the beginning of each EpochSetup phase, the admin initializes this contract with
*  the list of consensus nodes for the upcoming epoch. Each consensus node
*  can post as many messages as they want to the DKG "whiteboard" with the `Participant.postMessage()` method,
*  but each node can only submit a final submission once per epoch via the `Participant.sendFinalSubmission() method.
*  
*  Once a >50% threshold of consensus nodes have submitted the exact same set of keys,
*  the DKG phase is technically finished.
*  Anyone can query the state of the submissions with the FlowDKG.getFinalSubmissions()
*  or FlowDKG.dkgCompleted() methods.
*  Consensus nodes can continue to submit final messages even after the required amount have been submitted though.
* 
*  This contract is a member of a series of epoch smart contracts which coordinates the 
*  process of transitioning between epochs in Flow.
