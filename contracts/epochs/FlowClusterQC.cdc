/* 
*
*  Manages the process of collecting votes for the root quorum certificate of the upcoming
*  epoch for all collection node clusters assigned for the upcoming epoch.
*
*  When collector nodes are first registered, they can request a Voter object from this contract.
*  They'll use this object for every subsequent epoch where they are a staked collector node.
*
*  At the beginning of each EpochSetup phase, the admin initializes this contract with
*  the collector clusters for the upcoming epoch. Each collector node has a single vote
*  that is allocated for them and they can only call their `vote` function once.
*  
*  Once all the clusters have received enough identical votes to surpass their weight threshold,
*  The QC generation phase is finished and the admin will end the voting.
*  At any point, anyone can query the voting information for the clusters 
*  by using the `getClusters` function.
* 
*  This contract is a member of a series of epoch smart contracts which coordinates the 
*  process of transitioning between epochs in Flow.
