/*
 * The FlowStorageFees smart contract
 *
 * An account's storage capacity determines up to how much storage on chain it can use. 
 * A storage capacity is calculated by multiplying the amount of reserved flow with `StorageFee.storageMegaBytesPerReservedFLOW`
 * The minimum amount of flow tokens reserved for storage capacity is `FlowStorageFees.minimumStorageReservation` this is paid during account creation, by the creator.
 * 
 * At the end of all transactions, any account that had any value changed in their storage 
 * has their storage capacity checked against their storage used and their main flow token vault against the minimum reservation.
 * If any account fails this check the transaction wil fail.
 * 
 * An account moving/deleting its `FlowToken.Vault` resource will result 
 * in the transaction failing because the account will have no storage capacity.
 *
